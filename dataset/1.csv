AYUSH\/E\/2019\/00336  	Department of Health & Family Welfare	India	Delhi	North West Delhi	Siub : Complaint against Mis behavior by Mr Jagdeep at CGHS Kingsway CampDear SirThis my *nd complaint regarding gross inefficiency and unacceptable rude behaviors of staff at CGHS dispensary Kingsway Camp. On my *st complaint made to CGHS Director no action was taken   hence staff is at their full zeal to keep on threatening  misbehaving with public at large*. Today morning I approached the registration counter for taking appointment about my son and myself for Ayurveda consultation. The person on duty was Jagdeep. *. I was carrying color print out of online cards available at CGHS website which clearly mentioned that these cards are acceptable  ( I have recently lost my cards so due to urgency i took print out of card and presented at the counter) *. Jagdeep refused to accept these cards and threw it back to me stating that these are not acceptable and on explaining him the situation he said  You could be  fraudster .. he asked me to explain who signed these cards.. why he should accept this. I explained him the website remarks on which he started mis behaving and said  GO TO THE CGHS DIRECTOR WHO SIGNED THESE CRDS AND ASK HIM TO CALL ME ...ASK HIM TO GIVE ME SCANNER *ST USING WHICH I CAN READ  UR  ON CARD ETE ETC .  His tone and words were humiliating .  He even said take my name  Jagdeep  and do complaint to HO..I know how to manage them  . .......i kept on saying that my son is not well and he should accept these cards but he kept on  behaving arrogantly  mis behaved in front of public who was in line . Finally after repeated round of request he accepted but commented   you are a fraudster and threw back cards to me *.  I brought the incident to knowledge of CMO Mrs Bali  who just said   ill look into the matter .  I was expecting at least she should have taken some action or even summoned the concerned person but nothing happened. It seems that we are at mercy of CGHS staff and the way they behave is something which is beyond comprehension . We are not paying for the facility to face such things from the staff... I immediate demand action on my complaint and strict action should be initiated against the erring staff mentioned in my complaint. How can public servant use such humiliating  derogating remarks against public and can ignore his official duties.  Also I demand detailed report on my *st complaint and what action was taken against erring staff at that time It seems until unless CGHS HO department take concrete action these episodes would continue to happen	29/5/2019 11:47	19/6/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

AYUSH\/E\/2019\/00486  	Department of Defence	India	Punjab	Pathankot	Respected Minister of the concerned department  I want to discuss with you the INEQUALITIES FACED BY FEMALE DEFENCE ASPIRANTS IN THE SELECTION PROCESS I m SURBHI SHARMA  one of the defence aspirants from Pathankot Punjab. I have a sorted dream of joining Indian Army for Officer Entry. I appeared for CDS examination conducted by UPSC cleared it got recommended from SSB and was declared medically fit. I have cleared the Exam SSB and the Medical criteria from **SSB Allahbad **** June Inspite of scoring AIR ** I am not able to go to OTA due to less number of vacancies for females. Service Selection Board recommends a candidate since he\/she possess all the qualities to become an Army officer and can serve the nation in the best possible way however its the female candidates who are restricted by the LESS NUMBER OF VACANCIES FOR WOMEN CDS ENTRY i.e ** as compared to that of Men vacancies i.e ***.

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07075  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Tamilnadu	Kanchipuram	Dear Sir Before you read please do not assume that this grievance is policy related and do not forward it to the Tax Planning division. Pls read this carefully and understand the issue. If this is not clear please do call me at ********** before you decide on this grievance. This is my SEVENTH petition on the same issue and not even ONCE this is understood by CBDT. So please do not close the petition for the sake of it.I would like to point out the challenges in getting the PAN card with the correct name format. *. South Indians specifically Tamilians do not have the concept of First Name and Last Name. There is no Family Name or Last Name or Surname for us. We typically write our name as S. Murugan. The initial is the first letter of the fathers name. Some people write like Murugan . S. Is this clear at all*. Now the issue is twofold. When you apply for the Aadhaar one can easily get the Aadhaar card in the way he or she wants. For example one can get it like S. Murugan or S Murugan or Murugan. S or Murugan S. So getting an Aadhar in the correct name is easy for south indians.*. However when you apply for PAN Card you cannot get it like S. Murugan or Murugan . S or Murugan S In the PAN application form it asks for the last name and a citizen is forced to expand the initial fully as the Last Name. For example Murugan Sarangapani instead of Murugan S. So for PAN I am forced to change the way we write our names. Though one can print the card as Murugan S the database would still have the name as Murugan Sarangapani in the first name last name format only.*. Now that you get the PAN card with the First Name last Name format the next challenge happens while you try to link Aadhaar and PAN. Aadhaar would have Murugan S and PAN would say Murugan Sarangapani and very unfortunately the system could not match it and hence PAN and Aadhaar cannot be linked.*. It is so unfortunate that this issue was never thought through and we are forced to change our names in Aadhaar also. Essentially though my name is S. Murugan just because of all this I need to keep my name as Murugan Sarangapani for the records. It is like CUTTING THE LEG FOR SHOE SIZE.Hope you understand this. Would GOI allow south indians\/TAMILIANS to keep the name format as it is and not change it to first name last name format Pls understand and do not simply forward it to the Tax Planning team. Pls note that due to this lacunae we are not in a position to link Aadhar card with PAN. I am submitting this petition to the Registrar of the Supreme Court to take cognizance of this issue and file a PIL suo motu.Jai Hind. Regards S Murugan (not Murugan Sarangapani )	1/4/2019 11:47	4/4/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

I had paid self-assessment tax Rs *****\/ on **\/*\/****.Please note :-i)	I mistakenly used challan no *** instead of *** while paying self-assessment tax.ii)	Tax applicable code used was **** (other taxes on income and expenditure) and type of payment code used was ***(payment under income declaration scheme ****) instead of **** (non-company deductees) and ***(self-assessment tax) respectively.iii)	PAN was correct i.e.AJJPM****F and money was directly debited from my Axis bank account and credited to Income Tax account.iv)	The amount paid is not reflecting in my form **as because of above reason.v)	I have attached a copy of notice a copy of challan a copy of application I made to the ITO and a copy of response received from E-nivaran.I had called CPC Bangalore after receiving this notice and they suggested that I visit Income Tax Officer of my ward in person and get it rectified.

He suggested I submit an application along with a copy of demand notice and copy of challan *** used. I submitted the documents as advised on the same day. Unfortunately I did not hear back from him or anybody else from Bamboo Villa. Thereafter I made an application via E-nivaran on **\/*\/****.

There is no way I can get form **as credited using third party help as the money deposited is with IT dept. and they need to do something to transfer the money from one account to another. I have been advised by people with experience in this matter that since payment code *** i.e. income declaration scheme has been discontinued it may be tricky to transfer the money from payment code *** to payment code *** and that I should apply to CPGRAM for help.

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07169  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Maharashtra	Mumbai City	The assessing officer has closed the grievance  matter in an unjustifiable manner.  Prior to CPGRAM  the AO has not responded to any rectification request of the assessee. The first letter dated **th may **** requesting the issue of refund was  filed with the Assessing Officer on **\/**\/ **** . Till the submission of said letter the assessee has not received any intimation or any refund for the said year. Your honor may also observe from the subject of the letter  - Request To Issue  Refund .  After filing the letter the assessee followed up with AO and his inspector for the first time shared the online computation working u\/s ***(*)  in the month of June ****  showing  non credit of TDS of Rs. ***** \/- and refund of Rs.*****. This was not an intimation u\/s ***(*)(a) but online computation sheet. However relying on the said computation assessee filed its first rectification request wide letter dated **\/**\/ ****  flied on **\/**\/ ****. The subject of the letter was -Rectification Of Mistake U\/S ***. The said rectification was within  * years  after receipt of computation sheet in June ****. The said rectification request was carrying all the requisites documents for grant of TDS credit including  form **A. The assessee again on **\/**\/****  through letter dated **\/**\/ ****  filed indemnity bond for credit of TDS. Thereafter  assessee again filed follow up letter for rectification on **\/**\/**** **\/**\/**** and **\/**\/**** wide letter dated **\/**\/**** *\/**\/**** and  **\/**\/**** respectively. Irrespective of filing so many letters  till the date of filing the CPGRAM no response has been  received from the learned AO. Being thus aggrieved the asseessee filed the Grievance which was immediately rejected by the AO on the ground that the rectification is time barred and the grievance filed is misleading. In response to this the assessee submits that for calculating the period of * years date of receipt is to be considered and not date of passing of the intimation. The assessee received the computation sheet only in the month of June **** for the first time. Infect the intimation u\/s ***(*(a) was never shared with assessee . This can be supported by the online status on Income Tax Site under Return Filed Portal  which is showing the  status as ITR FILED and not as ITR PROCESSED.  Therefor the letter  submitted prior to this dates were having the subject  Request To Issue  Refund and letter filed thereafter was having the subject Rectification Of Mistake U\/S ***. It can also be observed that If the intimation was passed in **** itself then why part refund of Rs. *****\/- due as per ***(*) computation was released after ** years in July **** only. Further the asseessee would like to draw the attention on the fact that the AO never bothered to reply or reject the rectification application filed earlier. Only after filing the CPGRAM AO suddenly after so many years rejected the application.     The assessee hereby again request to kindly look into the matter and get the order rectified and get the refund released.	2/4/2019 12:43	11/4/2019	Local\/Internet	5	NA	12/4/2019 15:08

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07212  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Maharashtra	NA	Grievance Status for registration number : CBODT\/E\/****\/*****The above grievance has been closed with the following note. Department response: The assessing officer has reported that all pending rectification applications have been disposed off.  In some of the years the rectification applications have been rejected. If the applicant is aggrieved with the orders it can approach the CIT (A). Since all actions at our level have been disposed the grievance is treated as settled.The nature of the response by the department suggests they have hardly any time to address our pending matter which is lying for years. The officer has now pulled up the same old story providing the scanned documents downloaded from the site and backing up their argument in favour of the closure. Time and again we have clarified our requirement in person and submitted detailed calculation showing where the department has gone wrong. This is ridiculous that after tribunal order the effect giving is still pending and the officer is saying everything is closed. The department is claiming rectification petitions have been rejected. But the same have never been communicated to us. We could have appealed against the rejection if the rejection memo was made available to us. All our claims are factually and legally correct. We have provided a detailed year wise dossier besides meeting the officer concerned several times in the past explaining the rectification of order in respect of our matter and also consequential refund which are still pending. Each time we met the officer assured that necessary rectification would be done at the earliest. We have been intimated in the last month that another officer has been entrusted with the task to close all our old matters. The officer called us up and requested to be present at his office for clarifying few points. We requested him to go through our dossier first which was submitted to the ACIT Mr Sandeep Ahuja **(*)\/(*)  Aayakar Bhawan Mumbai. After few days when we called him up again to know the status he confirmed he has got the dossier he will study the content and shall revert to us at the earliest in case of any further requirement.  Now without any discussion the same story repeated by him that all issues are closed. We are requesting the officer concerned to provide us with the copy of the orders rejecting our claims so that we can go for appeals against the orders immediately.	3/4/2019 12:36	9/5/2019	Local\/Internet	1	We trusted the department and the officer for their gesture that all our issues would be resolved on priority in case we are not satisfied with the way matters have been disposed by the department. Finally month long exercise ended in negative and now the Asst. Com. is saying they do not know how to close the issue as the system is not supporting. Therefore this exercise in last one month resulted into complete harassment for us.   Further the disposal was not by way of passing any order it was only letter intimation and can not be appealed against.  Under this circumstances we are to state that none of our issues has been settled and department technically suggested us  to decide over our options including going for appeal.	1/7/2019 13:17

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07220  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	West Bengal	Kolkata	Dear Sirs this is in relation to the assessment year ****-** for the Assessee Niraj Kumar Agarwal PAN - ACJPA****Q. I am the brother of the assessee. The assessee had filed the return of income for this asstt year claiming deduction for Taxes withheld on earnings in New Zealand for that year against the tax liability on his earnings for the year from within and outside India. The Assessee is an Ordinarily Resident Indian. On **.**.**** the department raised a demand on the assessee by not allowing the deduction for taxes withheld outside India. The assessee filed several responses claiming rectification of the error on *.*.**** and again on *.**.**** praying the department to rectify the demand raised and issue the refund claimed for that year. However there was no action from the department on the matter. Instead the department adjusted the refunds of subsequent years against such demand. After adjusting the refunds of subsequent years the department also raised an interest demand on the original demand and further adjusted refunds of subsequent years against this interest demand. I met the department officials several times in the matter and also raised grievances and disputes against the demand on the Income tax e-filing portal but there has been no positive action from the department and the CPC in this matter. I got to understand from the department officials that the original records of return of income for that year have been misplaced and at the request of the department officials I re-submitted copies of the records and return of income for AY ****-** twice (on **.*.**** and *.*.****) so that the department could verify the return of income once again. However till date there has been no resolution of this matter and the assessee continues to suffer loss due to the above. We hereby pray and request the officials to kindly look into this matter and take necessary action of redressal of the grievance and rectification in the matter.

The assesse has disclosed in the return of income an amount of Rs ****** under the head capital gains which is contained and forms part of Form **AS.

CPC raising tax demand based on mere comparison of income declared by assessee under income from other sources and Form **AS completely lacks awareness and recognition of the provisions of Income Tax Act ****   A copy of payout report of various investments containing the bifurcation of capital gain and income from other source is enclosed for ready perusal. The capital gains amount has been highlighted in the payout reports and such capital gains amount form part of Form **AS.

Having faced continued apathy and indifferent attitude of Income Tax department in release of my legitimate Refund I am forced to submit my second grievance on this portal. My earlier grievance vied Registration No. C.B.O.D.T\/E\/****\/***** dated **\/**\/**** may be referred. My Income Tax return for A.Y. **** -** had Refund claim of Rs.*****\/- which has been withheld by Income Tax Department stating that it is proposed to adjust my aforesaid refund towards D.I.N ********* ********** dated ** Oct **** for the amount Rs.***** including interest raised by the Jurisdictional A.O. as outstanding Tax demand for the A.Y ****-**. As Income Tax due for A.Y. ****-** has been already deducted by my employer as T.D.S I kept on repeatedly approaching my department as well as authorities of Income Tax Department to take appropriate action and release my refund to save me from financial hardship. When nothing worked in my favor I submitted my C.P.G.R.A.M grievance dated **\/**\/**** quoted above. Thankfully the C.P.G.R.A.M grievance was closed by Income Tax Department on **\/**\/**** stating that credit of T.D.S for Rs.*****\/- was allowed manually after carried out rectification u\/s *** of the Income Tax Act **** dated **-**-**** and demand was reduced to NIL for the A.Y. ****-**. Hence the C.P.G.R.A.M stands fully Disposed off. Although this grievance was closed as fully disposed off I did not get my refund for A.Y ****-**. After waiting for more than a month I submitted my grievance dated **\/**\/**** on e-portal of Income Tax Department. Ironically this grievance too was disposed of stating that C.P.C is unable to release refund and it will be released by jurisdictional A.O. When I contacted authorities at C.P.C Bengaluru as well as Jurisdictional A.O each one of them did nothing but to shirk their responsibility by holding the other one responsible for release of refund. To my utter dismay my refund is yet to be released and I am still facing financial hardship. Hence I am forced to submit this fresh C.P.G.R.A.M. I humbly request that authorities concerned may kindly be directed to look into grievance of this soldier of the nation sympathetically so as to release my pending refund of excess T D S amounting to Rs. *****\/- at the earliest so that an honest taxpayer is not made to suffer for his honesty due to inaction of public authorities.

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07278  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Tamilnadu	Chennai	LINKING OF PAN WITH AADHARMANY who got  the PAN cards initially are unable to link them with Aadhars because of mismatch in the names. The PAN cards show the names in full in expanded forms instead of initials whereas their names in the Aadhaar cards are with labreviated initials. In a report that appeared in The Hindu of **th March **** the IT officials exhorted the card holder to change the names in Aadhar cards in accordance with PAN cards .    vide the report  Initials hurdle hits PAN -Aadhaar link ( The Hindu March **). The arguments put forward by the IT officials would appear preposterous and be not acceptable. In the initial stage when PAN was introduced the full names without abbreviated initials were shown on the PAN cards.Later a column was introduced in the form for application for PAN cards for indicating the names with initials.  Such cards with abreviated names along with initials were issued later.     No one would  use the full name in day- to -day transactions or  for banking etc. The educational certificates Passports  Passbooks etc would  show only names with initials. When  PAN cards have been issued showing names with initials later how could  the Deprt say that  no correction would be feasible now for others. If not possible linking with the Addhaar should be  done away with. Alternatively as linking would be an essential requirememts it could be done  by indicating Aadhaar number in the IT records and not by the manner now being done where the  the linkings would be rejected.   As only one number each  would be given for  a person in Aadhaar and PAN   though different  the persons could be traced easily at any time. Simple mention in IT return of the Aadhaar Number should be treated as linking and returns  given subsequently with another number  should be rejected or reasons investigated. IT dept should simplify the procedure instead of asking all PAN holders to correct the names in Aadhaars  Pass books etc. New PAN cards would always be issued after producing the Aadhaar cards indicating the names as given therein.K.RajendranChennai * Menaka flats	3/4/2019 21:31	4/4/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

The assessee has given several letters to the income tax department to resolve the issue but no action has been taken since last * years. copy of letter enclosed. In light of above we would request your honour to take neccessary action and direct the authorities to vacate the demand at the earliest. copy of letters  enclosed.The above grievance was closed without providing an opportunity of hearing. Hence this grievance:-The ITO Ward - **(*) Kolkata had stated in his letter dated **.**.**** that on the basis of documents submitted along with rectification petition filed u\/s *** of the I. T. Act **** that the mistake is not apparent from record and requires further verification and interpretation.The response given by ITO Ward - **(*) Kolkata is very casual and vague given the facts of the case. Along with the rectification petition and several reminders we have filed the hard copy of income tax return and xml file which were downloaded from the incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in portal. On perusal of the same it is apparent that the assessee company had rightly filed its income tax return. Further in order to verify the correctness of the Long Term Capital Gain (without STT) claimed by the assessee company various notices were issued by the Ld. ITO and in response to the said notices replies along with relevant documents were filed (on **.**.**** **.**.**** **.**.**** and **.**.****). Further arguments were placed at the time of filing the said documents and the Ld. ITO expressed his satisfaction and assured us that the matter would be resolved. Thereafter several visits were made requesting the Ld. ITO for earlier disposal however he delayed the matter by stating that he was preoccupied with other administrative work.The Ld. ITO had stated something about section code. As far as income tax act and return are concerned the assessee company had correctly claimed the Long Term Capital Gain (without STT) amount in the income tax return and is as per the provisions of Income Tax Act. Further the Income Tax Act nowhere states about the section code and it is supposed for internal purpose of the Income Tax Department and Income Tax System. Therefore we fail to understand why the assessee should be concerned about the section code as long as the claim made by the assessee company is correct and the heads of income are correctly filled. Sir if the Ld. ITO states that it is not his responsibility to look into the Income Tax System then whose responsibility it is.Sir the assessee company feels helpless in this situation and seeks resolution as the earliest.	4/4/2019 19:03	30/4/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07387  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	West Bengal	Burdwan (Bardhaman)	SSC is selecting candidates for GR C staff  on all India merit list for the income tax department  but after joining income tax department different regions make different seniority lists which give rise to various discrepancies litigations  court cases and most important that a senior candidate  in SSC merit list becomes junior to his counterpart  due to different seniority lists of different regions. When SSC is selecting candidates on all India merit list then all India seniority list should also be maintained at the centre based on the SSC merit list in the income tax department just as all India seniority is maintained from ITO onwards and promotion should be given  in any region based on all India seniority. This will end the problems of  interregional transfer  also of GR C Staff. This is infringement of equality because different regions making different seniority lists but all the candidates have been selected on all India merit list. Different regions treating the candidates differently where as all candidates should be treated equally. Thus  this is clear infringement of equality.	4/4/2019 20:09	9/5/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07439  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Haryana	Faridabad	my grievance CBODT-E-****-***** has been lying unresolved for the last * months despite daily reminders. All the complaints keep getting routed to the same officer who does not even bother to take a look.	5/4/2019 12:57	8/4/2019	Local\/Internet	1	It has been mentioned that this grievance is a duplicate and the original grievance is under process but officer fails to mention that all grievances must be closed within 60 days else an interim report needs to be filed detailing why more time is required. If anyone takes a look at the original grievance it would be clear that the same has been pending with the officer for more than 2 months now (in the system for 4 months) and no explanation is forthcoming as to what is taking so long. Clearly no attempt is being made to actually investigate the original grievance. Even when I offered to provide the call recording of the guilty officer it was ignored. Would have given zero rating if that was available.	8/4/2019 18:41

During the period ****-** I had filed Income Tax return Claiming refund of Rs. ****- towards the excess paid Income Tax.   But in July **** I received a demand for Rs. ****- as short paid Income Tax as per  Income TAx department computation sheet available online.  From the computation sheet arrived at by your office it was noticed that they have not considered the Relief under Section ** claimed by me which has resulted in not granting refund to me for the AY ****-** (FY- ****-**) and also for the refund claimed in AY ****-** Rs. ****- which has been adjusted by Income Tax office towards the above demand of Rs. ****-.The copies of Income Tax Return filed for the FY ****-** (AY ****-**) duly acknowledged by your office and the relevant Form ** furnished by the OFFICE OF COMMISSIONER OF CENTRAL EXCISE SALEM COMMISSIONERATE for the year clearly specifying Rs. *****- towards Relief under Section ** and the Income Tax returns & Form ** for the FY ****-** to ****-** for which relief claimed were also sent to the jurisdictional ITO on *.**.****.  Consequent to *th CPC the pay arrears received for the years ****-** to ****-** were available for claiming relief under Section ** of Income Tax Act by way of apportionment  in the respective financial years by filing Form **E. I had accordingly claimed Relief of Rs. *****- towards the salary arrears of Rs. *****- received during the financial year ****-** which was apportioned for the respective years.  The Commissioner of Central Excise Salem had on verification allowed the Relief of Rs. *****- and provided Form **  (The original already provided to department with the return filed) specifying refund of Rs. ****- payable to me. The above Income Tax Return was filed and duly acknowledged by Income Tax office as well.   But instead of granting me refund in the year **** they have raised a demand for Rs. ****- without even specifying the reason for such a demand.  I have downloaded the computation sheet available in the website and find that they have not offset the Relief amount of Rs. *****- which has resulted in irregular computation of working for the year ****-** resulting in the excess demand of Rs.****- (computation sheet retrieved from website attached).So I had made known my disagreement to the demand raised by Income TAx department on **.*.**** **.*.** **.*.** and **.*.**** and also sent the request to Income Tax department on *.**.**** with copies of documents\/returns to withdraw the unjustified demand notice issued and also recovery made to the extent of Rs. ****- refunded to me from my bank account in the AY ****-**.    I request that the above mistake at Income Tax office may please be corrected and the demand withdrawn and the refund of Rs. ****- for AY ****-** and Rs. ****- payable for AY ****-** may be paid with appropriate interest to me immediately.  In case I need to explain the facts in person I  also intimated my willingness but no response received till date and the refund of the wrongly deducted Income Tax has not been credited to me so far.	5/4/2019 14:46	25/4/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07506  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Maharashtra	Pune	This grievance on behalf of our client Shilpi Sharma with PAN AXOPS****B. She received a query from her Assessing Officer in end of Aug **** to explain a difference of INR **** when comparing data in Form **AS against data in filed return for AY ****-**. Her salary as per form **AS was higher by INR **** as compared to filed return. She approached us in start of Sep **** to help her with answering this query. On analysing we found that the difference was because Form **AS salary amount did not consider the Profession Tax deduction of INR **** which she had claimed while filing her return. This is a legitimate deduction allowed under sec **(*) of the Income Tax Act. And this is very normal - many employers report gross amount without deducting Profession Tax as Salary while filing their TDS returns. Frankly they are within their rights to say that they had credited the amount and then deducted Profession Tax from it. Now in filing TDS returns employers are asked to show Amount paid\/credited and not Amount of Salary Income. Obviously this difference is bound to occur. We responded to the query of the AO immediately. However few days back our client Shilpi Sharma informed us that she has been asked to pay INR **** as a demand for AY ****-**. The demand was raised under sec ***(*). On analysing this we found that the demand was solely attributable to that difference of INR **** which we had already explained earlier. On further investigation we found that the AO had not even looked at the response provided by us. Status of our response was - Submitted. It wasnt considered at all. This is unacceptable. We immediately raised a rectification request and raised an e Nivaran request on ** March ****. We asked the AO to respond by today * April ****. Since he hasnt responded we are raising this grievance on behalf of our client Shilpi Sharma. We cannot wait because we are sure that AO will not even look at what we have written to him and what documents have we provided. In absence of any preventive action from our end he might initiate totally frivolous recovery proceedings. This is clear case of Tax Terrorism. We can relate this to the diktat issued to each AO to recover as much money from txpayers as possible since there is a major shortfall in recovery. While we do understand that the CBDT order would be well intentioned it surely does not mean that honest taxpayers should be falsely harassed. This is clear violation of law when a taxpayer is not allowed to claim legitimate deductions and asked to pay taxes purely based on amounts as per Form **AS. And the AO does not even read the response to his query that we give. Under which section is it mentioned that income as per Form **AS will be taken as final. If that is so why are even taxpayers required to file returns. Simply take the Form **AS amount recover taxes and thats it. No deductions allowed nothing. Our client is anyways paying large amounts of taxes. Even for AY ****-** she paid almost *.* lakhs in taxes. Stillthe AO is after her to harass her mentally with this terror or tax laws. We suspect that the AO thinks that since our client is willingly paying taxes she will pay some more too very easily and he could achieve his target easily. At the same time he wont be required to spend efforts in recovering taxes from genuine evaders. This is typical of AOs in Pune. They might think that there is all Techie crowd in Pune no one will challenge him. But they do not know that tax practitioners are around for this very purpose - to call out their bluff. Request you to look into this matter on a priority and save our client from undue harassment. If at all she deserves recognition for paying taxes without claiming too many legitimate deductions. Let us set a good example. Let us not dissuade honest taxpayers by harassing them for paying more and more taxes. We demand a compensation for our client of INR ***** and a quick closure of this matter.	5/4/2019 22:30	21/5/2019	Local\/Internet	1	Factually incorrect response	25/5/2019 13:26

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07508  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	USA	Not Known	No District\/Not Known	This is to put to your attention that Saint Francis hospital at Ajmer Rajasthan is is indulging in tax evasion.  Since they are not accepting any form of payment other than cash.   Patients are willing to pay the amount they want to charge by card paytm checks but they are refusing to take any and forcing patients to pay in cash and let them run around to ATMs in the middle of night for cash.  Which is harassment and annoying to the patients.  Someone should speak for this since there is no motive other than stealing taxes by charging patients only in cash.

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07516  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Delhi	Central Delhi	By seeking more details about presently tax-free agricultural income in newly introduced Income-Tax-Return ITR forms like name of district with PIN-code area of agricultural land and irrigation-details etc. Central Board of Direct Taxes CBDT has indicated confession about large-scale misuse of tax-free agricultural-income by ultra-rich persons including politicians and celebrities in all fields including from film-industry and leading sports-persons. But even providing such details as sought in newly introduced ITR forms misuse of tax-free provision of agricultural income by ultra-rich non-farmers cannot be stopped. These persons will declare their lavish farm-houses as agricultural land even though these farm-houses are in fact used as lavish resorts for week-ends and holding parties. Booster-pumps installed to fill swimming-pools in farm-houses will be declared as means of irrigation.Only some basic amount should be exempted as tax-free agricultural income so that only really deserving small farmers may be kept out of Income Tax provisions. A study can be made for determining such tax-free limit for agricultural income. Income Tax cases of earlier years for ultra-rich persons having declared huge agricultural income should be re-opened for exposing such tax-evaders and recovery of tax-evaded in name of agricultural income.	6/4/2019 8:22	6/5/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

I have nothing to eat no funds for children education nobody is giving me job as my identity is disclosed due to frequent visit to the Income Tax Office Ludhiana If anything happens to me and my family the Department will be responsible for the same.In spite of my repeated requests the D G I T is not paying any heed nor releasing the reward payment.

Accordingly the Company once again withdrew the CPGRAM application - Grievance *.  However the Company has not received the refund for AY ****-** till date.*.	Based on our recent discussions with the jurisdictional tax officers we understand that the refund has now been kept on hold due to an erroneous refund of Rs *.** Crore appearing as issued to the Company in the ITBA system of the department for which no records are available with the Income Tax Department.  We wish to respectfully submit that the Company has not received any such refund of Rs. *.** Crore for the year in the past and that the same is completely erroneous and is liable to be deleted.The Company has filed multiple letters including the filing of * Grievances and has persistently followed up with the office of the DCIT as well as the senior tax officers of the jurisdiction including the Additional Commissioner of Income-tax - Circle ** (*) and Circle *(*) (ACIT) and the office of the Principal Commissioner of Income-tax - ** and Circle * (PCIT).

Application u\/s *** for rectification of Assessment Order dated December ** **** passed u\/s ***(*) of the Act. With reference to the same we have to state as under:Non-receipt of Refund of Rs.******** determined as per Assessment Order dated December ** **** passed u\/s ***(*) of the Act:We received an Assessment Order dated December ** **** (Order) passed u\/s ***(*) along with Notice of demand u\/s *** of the Act showing a sum of Rs.

It is very disappointing to note that even after * and half months of passing the Order \/ determining the Refund we have not received the said Refund till date.In view of the above facts & circumstances we request your good self to kindly release the aforesaid Refund of Rs.******** along with interest u\/s ***A up to the date of granting such refund at the earliest.Short granting of Interest u\/s ***A in the Assessment Order passed u\/s ***(*):As mentioned above as per the aforesaid assessment order interest amounting to Rs. *******  has been granted on Refund of Rs.********The said interest has been calculated @ *.* per p.m. on Refund of Rs.******** for a period of ** months from April * **** to March ** ****.Even after passing the Order u\/s ***(*) in December **** the said refund has still not been granted to the Company till date.In view of the above facts & circumstances we request your good self to kindly release the Refund of Rs.******** along with interest u\/s ***A up to the date of granting such refund.As the aforesaid mistake is apparent from the records we request you to kindly rectify the same by passing an Order u\/s *** of the Act and to also grant the Refund Due of Rs.******** along with Interest u\/s ***A of the Act till the date of granting such refund.We further submit that the Company is facing acute liquidity crunch and the legitimate refund due to the Company be granted at the earliest otherwise it will cause great hardship to the Company as substantial funds are blocked in TDS Refund. We therefore sincerely urge and humbly request you to rectify the aforesaid Order by passing an order u\/s *** of the Act & grant the Refund Due to the Company along with Interest u\/s ***A at the earliest.	8/4/2019 16:55	16/5/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

In fact two  person who protested were beaten by his Goons mercilessly almost to death hence those poor People living near village Bhaidi. After grabbing their lands Ranvir Singh Constructed Bunglow misusing Gov Funds of Village Panchayat approx. Rs. ** Laks. Few People made Complaint but local Police & administration is bribed and made silent and till date no action Not even FIR Registered.ii)Benamy Property Act : Wealth in form of Lands worth Crores of Rs at Village Chhacchu Bigha Rajgir Nalanda Deoghar (Jharkhand) in name of his wife Married daughters. In order to divert black money during Demonetization Constructed School with name Sai International (www.srisainathschool.com) at village More. Having *-* trucks three cars property worth crores etc. All this in just last * to * years without any job business or agricultures.iii) Wealth above income: Ranvir Singh main source of income has been Bank ATMs Fraud and Fake advertisement at katrisarai. Unfortunately almost ** of youngsters from Villages are doing this dirty job under his umbrella. Then illegal Sand-mining forgery of certificates for Teachers Job are his regular income in Laks \/ Month but Local Police are given monthly commission of Laks who protect him at all time.iv)Corruption : Since time he has been elected to Village Samiti and presently Jila Parishad (Katrisarai Block) Nalanda Bihar the entire Fund (in tune of about Rs.* crores in last * years) coming from Central or Bihar Government is being misused by him for his personnel benefit house and school construction. He submitted False affidavit during his election. v) Land grabbing : He has grabbed almost all the available Public\/ Garmazarua Land that were left by ancestors for public use such as Irrigation Canal Lakes even did not left mortuary \/ Samshan Ghat (** ekars of Land) and now only * or * ekar left south outskirt of village Chaachhu Bigha & Bhaidi etc. Local Circle officer (Katrisaria and P.S.) aware and Complaint given several times but no action till date.Criminal Records : Ranvir Singh has many criminal Records against him for destroying Peace and Law order in which two villages had severe tension and life threat. He was in judicial custody for more than an year or so he was again caught with Narcotics\/ Drugs (Ganza) at Kolkata and after bail disappeared several cases under Arms and threat to Life and Property to others are under trial before the Nalanda at Biharshariff Civil Court Nalanda Bihar. Sir since the matter is of grievous nature and it is certain that Local villagers are always in fearful from him hence Independent Judicial Inquiry by a sitting Judge OR Magisterial Inquiry under supervision of Court would be most appropriate and once he is taken into Judicial Custody and brought to Delhi like a place  from where he cannot influence the witnesses many villagers will come forward and support as witness.I expect confidentiality of my name and not to be revealed out.With regards.	8/4/2019 20:52	10/5/2019	Local\/Internet	N	NA	NA

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07672  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Tamilnadu	Coimbatore	Hello I had applied for PAN card correction for my name by **-Jan-** and made the payment online. Later I had submitted the form along with proof in UTI office but they have missed my proof and sent the application. Upon checking the status I came to know PAN processing is withheld I then sent an email to the customer care mentioned. They had requested me to send the proofs over email. I sent the documents but they where mailing the same reply again and again also were requesting to send my fathers proof too I sent that as well but the same response from them to send the proof in-spite of my reply. Later someone asked to send gazetted proof. I called the number that was provided in the mail agent kept me on hold for more than **min on the call (agent wasnt clear on the process and kept me hold several times) and while I was inquiring after the call resumed the connection got disconnected. I was unable to contact that number after that they werent also not bothered to ring back again to address my issue. Every time when I send a mail simply they have created a ticket and actioned nothing on it.  Several times I had sent the proof over email. I even requested them to atleast print the card with details that are already present as I have already made the payment but they dint mind responding that as well. Also I had asked the refund incase if they cant do any I got a reply that it cannot be refunded. I have sent so many mails they just kept creating the tickets. I got fed up of following up with them and left process as there is no action from their end. Please find the informations that are attached and kindly help me in getting the card if there is any possibility.  I have attached the mail communications for you reference.Am sorry if this isnt the right department kindly forward to the respective department in case of any wrong selection.PAN Application number - MC********Date - **-**-****Ref tickets raised - (******) (******) (******)RegardsKasthuri Kumar M	9/4/2019 5:15	23/4/2019	Local\/Internet	5	Dear MadamThank you for the swift response from your end in processing my request.Your help is much appreciated on this regard which i was following up past few months.	23/4/2019 18:47

I have filed multiple letters with the AO for rectification of demands raised erroneously by CPC which is resulting in undue mental torture to the assessee and equally wrong adjustment of refunds against following years. Even after filing of returns and in some cases even after assessment u\/s ***(*) the system reflects incorrect demand. Also in many cases Self assessment challans are not reflecting resulting in unnecessary demand. Following are the AYs which are not been rectified by the AO even after multiple letters filedAY. ****-** ****-** ****-** ****-** ****-** ****-** ****-** ****-**Attached scanned copies of letters for ready reference. Need information on actions taken on each of the letters filed	9/4/2019 18:43	7/5/2019	Local\/Internet	1	why grievances raised are closed without the prior intimation of closure to the applicant. The matter is not resolved till date and the case has been closed only based upon comments from the office of AO. Atleast seek prior feedback about whether the matter has been resolved or not before closing.	17/5/2019 18:32

CBODT\/E\/2019\/07778  	Central Board of Direct Taxes (Income Tax)	India	Maharashtra	Thane	Dear Sir \/ MadamFor the A.Y. ****-** onwards while processing of Income Tax Returns (ITR-*) of Trusts it has been noticed that the CPC has issued intimation u\/s ***(*)(a) to many Trusts who have filed belated return stating the error description as follows - (As per Section **A(*)(ba) income tax act **** the person in receipt of the income has furnished the return of income for the previous year in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (*A) of section *** within the time allowed under that section. otherwise the exemption u\/s **. i.e. sr. n. *(i) adn * viii in Schedule Part BTI is not allowed.) Consequently all the expenses incurred by the Trust has been treated as not to be allowed and entire amount of expense is proposed to be added back.A plain reading of sec. ***(*A) states that the Income Tax Return has to be furnished in the specified form and with the requisite particulars as applicable for returns u\/s ***(*). However the time limit has not been mentioned in sec. ***(*A). Hence it is not to be construed that for claiming exemption u\/s ** and ** return has to be filed within due date as per sec. ***(*). Also kind attention has to be given to the Budget memorandum of Finance Bill **** wherein on page ** it has been stated that (In order to provide clarity in this regard it is proposed to further amend section **A so as to provide for further condition that - the person in receipt of the income chargeable to income-tax shall furnish the return of income within the time allowed under section *** of the Act. These amendments are clarificatory in nature.)Therefore even belated returns filed u\/s ***(*) are eligible for exemption u\/s **. Further the memorandum itself states that the amendments are clarificatory in nature which clearly means that there should be no change in the position of law. for all the previous years too exemptions u\/s ** (except for exemption u\/s **(*)) were allowed for returns in Form ITR-* filed belated. Hence there should be no change in the position of law.It is important to realise that most of trust are spending more than ** percent of the income earned by them. If such expense is not allowed it will create an absurd situation where the expense actually made by the Trust is not allowed under the garb of misinterpretation of law and ** percent of tax is levied on the total income of the Trust creating huge demands where in fact all the income has been applied for objects of the Trust.  The same is going to increase the litigation and costs attached thereto. It is a humble request to take active note of the situation and take proper interpretation of the law within the spirit of law and justice and suitable instructions be issued to the CPC for processing of the ITR accordingly. Awaiting favourable response in this regard.	9/4/2019 19:25	10/5/2019	Local\/Internet	4	NA	11/5/2019 12:18
